I am doing a project in my university.I hope to get more people joining and collaborating with me to make this project to be happening.


**Project Description:**

This is an application that enable Android device transformed into a wireless game controller for PC game (for now focus on Window) which can provide user similar experience what game pad(Xbox 360,PS3), joystick, steering wheel, light gun and keyboard+mouse can perform. This application will use touchscreen, G-sensor (accelerometer), Gyro sensor, proximity sensor and etc depending on which android phone is targeted.

To add value into this app, users are allowed to design their controller interface to have a more comfortable and flexible thumb pressing experience. By providing the users the ability to mix and match their own game controller and configure buttons/pads setting, users can have different gaming experience in the one particular game with our application.  In future, users are possible to share their design with others.

Wireless connection includes either bluetooth or wifi depends on available connection from user.


The project would be an implementation and enhancement on the idea in this video.
